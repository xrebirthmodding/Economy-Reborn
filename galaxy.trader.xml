<!-- DEBUG: 1) you addressed the wrong Attribute -- there is no "range" attribute there, just one called "exact" 
2) you tried to write an incorrect Value there, so it would thave looked like 
<set_value name="$range" exact="<range = this.ship.galaxy/>" /> if 1 were correct (i think the Game wouldnt apply this because its breaking the syntax) Should be fixed now -->
